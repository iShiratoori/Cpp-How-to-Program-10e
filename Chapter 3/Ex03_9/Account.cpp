// Modify class Account (Fig. 3.8) to provide a member function
//called withdraw that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the withdrawal amount does
//not exceed the Accountâ€™s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the member
//function should display a message indicating "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance."
//Modify class AccountTest (Fig. 3.9) to test member function withdraw
